cut command 
cut <options>  filename
-c cut by characters 
-f cut by fields
-d define delimeter
we need to use -d while using -f flag
cut -c1-6 /etc/passwd|tail -2 to get chracter from last from 1 character 
to last character
if we used here -c1,3 /etc/passwd
cut -d ":" -f1,7
cat /var/log/messages | tail -5 |cut -d " " -f1-4 > /tmp/information
where not specific indents for delimeter  cut command not used here awk 
command comes in seen 

awk automatically calculated space 
df -h |awk '{print $1}'
df -h |awk '{print $1,$2,$6}'|column -t used for representing data in 
command
ifconfig | grep -w inet |awk '{print $1,$2}' OFS='---------->'|sed -n '1p'
OFS-output field seprator 
for giving delimeter we use -F 
awk -F ":" '{print $1,$3}' |head |column -t

zipping files

gzip demo.txt compressing a file
zcat is used for reading compressed files 
gunzip demo.txt.gz for unzip a file 
bzip2 demo.txt
bzcat is used for reading content of bzip file
bzmore for reading content of bz extension file
bunzip2 to unzip bz extension file use command
tar -cvf  for zipping more then one file tar -cvf sample.txt demo.txt 
tar -cvjf for zipping file in tbz format
tar -cvjf demo.tar.tbz demo.txt
tar -cvzf demo.tar.gz demo.txt z used for gz format 

if we want to view which files are unzip in zip files we can view -tar tvf 
practise.tar
for searching  file in zip files- tar tvf practise.tar demo.txt
