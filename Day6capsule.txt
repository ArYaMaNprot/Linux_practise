###cut command used by two ways:
 cut <options>
-c cut by characters
-f used to cut output by fields
-d define delimeter
cut c1 /etc/passwd to cut first characters of lines 
cut -c1-6 /etc/passwd to cut characters continuosly from first to sixth character
cut -c1,3 /etc/passwd to get first or third character only
cut -d ":" -f1 to used to cut first field only
awk command comes in seen when cut command fails at certain amount of delimeter when space is given.
awk calculates spaces automatically 
df -h | awk '{prit $1,$2,$3 }' print the fields
column -t command used for
df -h |grep sda1 |awk '{print $5}' 
awk '{print $2}' OFS='--------->' OFS=output field seprator
awk -f ":" '{print $1,$3}' -f flag used here for passing delimeter 
sleep 10 to sleep for 10sec
gzip command used for zipping file with .gz extension
cut command 
cut <options>  filename
-c cut by characters 
-f cut by fields
-d define delimeter
we need to use -d while using -f flag
cut -c1-6 /etc/passwd|tail -2 to get chracter from last from 1 character to last character
if we used here -c1,3 /etc/passwd
cut -d ":" -f1,7
cat /var/log/messages | tail -5 |cut -d " " -f1-4 > /tmp/information
where not specific indents for delimeter  cut command not used here awk command comes in seen 

awk automatically calculated space 
df -h |awk '{print $1}'
df -h |awk '{print $1,$2,$6}'|column -t used for representing data in command
ifconfig | grep -w inet |awk '{print $1,$2}' OFS='---------->'|sed -n '1p'
OFS-output field seprator 
for giving delimeter we use -F 
awk -F ":" '{print $1,$3}' |head |column -t

zipping files

gzip demo.txt compressing a file
zcat is used for reading compressed files 
gunzip demo.txt.gz for unzip a file 
bzip2 demo.txt
bzcat is used for reading content of bzip file
bzmore for reading content of bz extension file
bunzip2 to unzip bz extension file use command
tar -cvf  for zipping more then one file tar -cvf sample.txt demo.txt 
tar -cvjf for zipping file in tbz format
tar -cvjf demo.tar.tbz demo.txt
tar -cvzf demo.tar.gz demo.txt z used for gz format 

if we want to view which files are unzip in zip files we can view -tar tvf practise.tar
for searching  file in zip files- tar tvf practise.tar demo.txt
